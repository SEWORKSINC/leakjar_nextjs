## 2.2 Intelligence Collection Process

LeakJar's four-step intelligence pipeline:

**Step 1: Collection**
Our global network continuously gathers leaked credential data from underground forums, HUMINT operatives, and exclusive threat intelligence sources. We collect data you won't find through traditional channels.

**Step 2: Processing**
Advanced algorithms process hundreds of gigabytes daily, extracting critical data points including credentials, IPs, timestamps, and breach context. Hybrid AI and human expert analysis ensures accuracy.

**Step 3: Matching**
Intelligent matching compares credentials against customer-registered domains and email addresses. Risk scoring prioritizes threats requiring immediate attention.

**Step 4: Alerting**
Instant notifications via dashboard, email, or API with detailed forensic information and actionable security recommendations. Sub-1-hour average alert delivery.

SECTION 3: COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK SUPPORT
================================================================================

## 3.1 PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance

**Requirement 8.3.10**: If passwords/passphrases are used as an authentication factor to meet Requirement 8.3.1, they are either:
- Verified against a list of known bad passwords/passphrases and blocked if found on the list
- OR Changed to a unique value that is not on any such list

**LeakJar Capability**: Real-time credential monitoring against 60B+ leaked records enables automatic detection and blocking of compromised passwords, satisfying Requirement 8.3.10.

**Compliance Evidence Provided**:
- Audit logs of all credential checks
- Alert history with timestamps
- Compliance status dashboard
- QSA-ready documentation

**Deadline**: March 31, 2025 (PASSED - NOW MANDATORY)

## 3.2 NIST SP 800-63B Compliance

**Section 5.1.1.2**: When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised.

**LeakJar Capability**: Continuous monitoring against comprehensive breach databases ensures compromised credentials are detected and can be blocked at authentication.

**Applicable NIST Controls**:
- PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed
- DE.CM-1: The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events
- RS.AN-1: Notifications from detection systems are investigated

## 3.3 HIPAA Security Rule Compliance

**164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)**: Risk Analysis - Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.

**LeakJar Capability**: Credential monitoring addresses the risk of unauthorized ePHI access through compromised credentials, supporting Security Risk Analysis requirements.

**Applicable Safeguards**:
- Administrative Safeguards: Security awareness training (workforce knows about breach alerts)
- Technical Safeguards: Access control (compromised credentials detected and revoked)
- Physical Safeguards: N/A (LeakJar is cloud-based)

## 3.4 GDPR Article 32 Compliance

**Article 32(1)**: Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including:
- (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data
- (b) ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
- (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating effectiveness

**LeakJar Capability**: Credential monitoring represents "state of the art" security measure for protecting personal data access, supporting Article 32 compliance.

## 3.5 CCPA/CPRA Compliance

**Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.150**: Private right of action for unauthorized access resulting from business's failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices.

**LeakJar Capability**: Credential monitoring demonstrates "reasonable security" by actively detecting and responding to compromised access credentials.

## 3.6 EU AI Act Compliance

**Article 15**: High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an appropriate level of robustness against errors, faults or inconsistencies.

**LeakJar Capability**: Protects AI training data pipelines from data poisoning attacks by detecting compromised credentials that could provide unauthorized access to ML infrastructure.
